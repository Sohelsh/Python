# 🗓️ Day 1 – Python Basics: Variables & Data Types

---

## 🧩 Variable
> Variables are used to **store data** during the execution of a program.  
> A variable name acts as a **reference** to a value stored in memory.

**Example:**
```python
x = 10
name = "Sohel"
print(x, name)
```

---


## 🧩 Data Types
> In Python, every data type is actually a class, and variables are instances (objects) of these classes  

**Example:**
```python
x = 4 + 4j
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'complex'>
